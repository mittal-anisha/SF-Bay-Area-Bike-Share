# SF-Bay-Area-Bike-Share

## ABOUT THE DATA
The Bay Area Bike Share enables quick, easy, and affordable bike trips around the San Francisco Bay Area.
They make regular open data releases plus maintain a real-time API. There are 4 data sets available, out of which 3 are used for this paper. 
The data are as follows:
1. station - Contains data that represents a station where users can pick up or return bikes.
2. trip - Data about individual bike trips
3. weather - Data about the weather on a specific day for certain zip codes

## Assumption
As the data is of daily values from the years 2013-2015, it is assumed the bikes are manual and not e-bikes.

## OBJECTIVES
Based on the insights, where possible, suggest approach/es to optimize the bike placement/reallocation schedule for the operator by considering usage patterns during the day and week, weather, and ride distances.
